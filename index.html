<h2>Welcome</h2>
In conclusion, I strongly believe that violent video games can cause people to show violent behavior.
The quantitative data shows that violent games causes more aggression so, they may fight and bully more.
The experiment done by an expert researcher demonstrates
that playing violent video games causes people to become insensitive to real-life violence.
Lastly, my anecdote shows that exposure to violent video games can lower kindness and empathy.
Therefore, to keep us from being violent, we have to decrease or stop playing violent video games.
