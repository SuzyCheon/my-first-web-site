<h2>violent game and violence</h2>
Have you ever felt happy when you played adorable animal video games?
However, have you ever become violent when you played violent video games?
In my opinion, some video games, such as animal games, can give us happiness.
However, most video games, especially violent games, cause violent behavior.
Therefore, I am going to support my opinion by using quantitative data,
expert opinion, and anecdotal evidence.
