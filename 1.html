<h2>Suzy + Essay "the dumbest generation"</h2>

Have you ever felt happy when you played <strong>adorable <u>animal</u> video games</strong>?
However, have you ever become violent when you played violent video games?<br>
In my opinion, some video games, such as animal games, can give us happiness.<br>
However, most video games, especially violent games, cause violent behavior.<br>
Therefore, I am going to support my opinion by using quantitative data, expert opinion, and anecdotal evidence.
